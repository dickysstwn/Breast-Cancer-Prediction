# Breast Cancer Prediction
In society, there are diseases that have a tremendous impact on sufferers, one of which is breast cancer. Breast cancer if not treated immediately can cause death. The government is trying to reduce the mortality rate of breast cancer patients in various ways, one of which is by classifying and predicting breast cancer. Patient data and patient health conditions began to be intensified to be recorded by the Government, then the dataset was used as material for prediction models that could help predict and classify the health of breast cancer patients. In this repository, I try to apply machine learning algorithms in producing accurate predictive models that can be used to identify key variables that affect the life expectancy of breast cancer patients.
